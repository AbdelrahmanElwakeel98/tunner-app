<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>An android accordion tuner with strobe and multiple notes.</p>

<h3>Using</h3>

<p>Hold the phone/tablet near the instrument, play a note and observe the
    display. In portrait the app shows a scope with the input signal, a
    spectrum showing the processed signal, the main display with the note
    value, cents error, frequency error etc, a strobe display and a meter
    display showing the cents error. In landscape the app shows just the
    main display and the meter. There is a signal indicator in the action
    bar which is useful in landscape mode. Using the touch setting changes
    below causes a short notification message to pop up for a few seconds.
</p>

<h4>Scope</h4>

    to tune bass reeds by reducing harmonics. Touch again to remove
    it. Touch and hold to add a fundamental filter to remove spurious
    harmonics. Touch and hold again to remove it. The colours have been
    chosen both for clarity, and for that 'retro' look like a real piece
    of hardware.

<h4>Spectrum</h4>

    show up to eight reeds. Touch again to zoom back out. Touch and hold
